# Weather-App

## Prerequisites
    This program does not require prerequisites. It is a webpage available for all to view. 

## Description
    This application is used to view weather data. The user can search for a city and view the current and 5-day future weather conditions for: Temperature, Rain/Sun, Humidity, and Wind Speed. The previously searched locations are displayed on the page. Clicking on a location in the search history will display the weather for that location, once again. 
  ## Deployment
    Open "Index.html" in a browser window.
